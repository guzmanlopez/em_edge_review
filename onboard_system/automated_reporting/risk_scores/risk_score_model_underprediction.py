    """Calculate the aggregated risk score for the day based on model underprediction and unprocessed videos.

    For the elog component, as elogs report retained catch only, elog catches are compared against the retained catches predicted by the model.
    The rules are:
      - if underprediction_flag:
          under_ratio ≤ UNDER_RATIO_HIGH → risk 2
          under_ratio  > UNDER_RATIO_HIGH → risk 3
      - elif model predicted something (catches_retained_model > 0): risk 1
      - else: 0

    For the unprocessed videos component, a comparison between the day's video list and processed videos is made. Then, a risk score is assigned following these rules:
      - unprocessed% ≤ UNPROCESSED_LOW   → 1
      - UNPROCESSED_LOW < % ≤ UNPROCESSED_HIGH → 2
      - % > UNPROCESSED_HIGH → 3
      - if no video_list → 0

    The final risk score is the maximum of the two scores.

    Args:
        risk_score_elogs (dict): A dictionary containing the elogs risk score.
            - "date": The date of the record.

        video_list (list): A list of video file names for a certain date.
